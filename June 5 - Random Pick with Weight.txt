Question - https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/june-leetcoding-challenge/539/week-1-june-1st-june-7th/3351/

Logic - suppose weights = [1, 3]
then 3 is larger, so there are high chances to get index 1.

We can know the chances of selecting each index by knowing their probability.

P(i) = weight[i]/totalWeight

totalWeight = 1 + 3 = 4
So, for index 0, P(0) = 1/4  = 0.25 = 25%
for index 1, P(1) = 3/4 = 0.75 = 75%

So, there are 25% of chances to pick index 0 and 75% chances to pick index 1.


Code -

class Solution {
    private double[] probabilities;
    
    public Solution(int[] w) {
        double sum = 0;
        this.probabilities = new double[w.length];
        for(int weight : w)
            sum += weight;
        for(int i = 0; i < w.length; i++){
            w[i] += (i == 0) ? 0 : w[i - 1];
            probabilities[i] = w[i]/sum; 
            System.out.println(probabilities[i]);
        }
    }
     
    public int pickIndex() {
        return Math.abs(Arrays.binarySearch(this.probabilities, Math.random())) - 1;
    }
}
