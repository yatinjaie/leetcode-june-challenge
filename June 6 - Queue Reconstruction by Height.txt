Logic - First sort all the people in decreasing order of there height. For those who have the same height, sort them in ascending order of there k-values.
Now simply iterate over the sorted array and insert them in the output array at indices equal to there k-values.


Code -

class Solution {
    public int[][] reconstructQueue(int[][] people) {
        Arrays.sort(people, (a, b) -> a[0] == b[0] ? a[1] - b[1] : b[0] - a[0]);
        List<int[]> res = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int[] p : people){
            res.add(p[1], p);
        }
        int n = people.length;
        return res.toArray(new int[n][2]);
    }
}
